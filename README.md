# **Garg-Miles-Jupiter**  
This repository contains all files and resources related to the **Garg-Miles-Jupiter** project.  

## **Project Overview**  
The primary goal of this project is to provide a structured and well-documented approach to analyzing and processing Jupiter-related datasets. This includes data manipulation, image processing, and computational analysis required for the research.

## **File Structure & Explanation**  

- **`Main Commented.ipynb`** – This is a fully documented version of the main script, created to enhance readability and facilitate understanding. It includes detailed comments explaining each line of code, ensuring that anyone reviewing the project can easily interpret its functionality.  
- **`Main Separated.ipynb`** – This file contains the core code without extensive inline comments. It serves as a cleaner, execution-ready version of the project for those already familiar with the workflow.  

The **commentary and documentation** within `Main Commented.ipynb` have been carefully structured using my own working knowledge of code, supplemented by resources such as **Stack Overflow** and **ChatGPT** for refining explanations and improving clarity.

## **Usage & Contribution**  
This project is structured to be accessible for both **personal reference** and **collaborative work**. If you're working on this project or using its components for your own research, feel free to reach out with questions or contributions.
