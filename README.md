## Project Overview

The primary objective of this research project is to develop and implement a robust workflow for analyzing astronomical images of Jupiter. This involves processing raw image data, identifying and characterizing features, and performing relevant computations to extract scientific insights. The code aims to provide a structured and reproducible approach to these tasks.

## Repository Structure

* **`images/`**: Output directory for processed images and visualizations (Note: your deliverable images are currently in the root, not here).
* **`Main Code Sequence.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with the primary image processing and analysis pipeline.
* **`orientation algorithm.ipynb`**: Experimental Jupyter Notebook for image auto-rotation using deep learning.
* **`outcome 1.png`**: First deliverable image output.
* **`outcome 2.png`**: Second deliverable image output.
* **`parallel_worker.py`**: Python script supporting parallel processing functionalities in the main notebook.
* **`README.md`**: This documentation file.
* **`T2.jpg`**: Reference image used for model training and feature-based image rotation.

**File Explanations (Details):**

* **`images/`**: This directory is intended for output images, plots, and visual results generated by the `Main code sequence.ipynb` notebook.
* **`Main Code Sequence.ipynb`**: The core Jupyter Notebook that orchestrates the data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps. It includes detailed comments for clarity.
* **`orientation algorithm.ipynb`**: A supplementary notebook detailing an experimental approach to automate image orientation using deep learning techniques.
* **`outcome 1.png` / `outcome 2.png`**: These are example output images showcasing results from the project's analysis.
* **`parallel_worker.py`**: A utility script designed to enable parallel execution of certain computationally intensive tasks within the main notebook, improving efficiency.
* **`T2.jpg`**: A reference image utilized in the `orientation algorithm.ipynb` for training a model and performing key feature alignment for image rotation.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (for running `.ipynb` files)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download files):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
    Alternatively, download all files and folders and ensure they are placed in the same root directory.

2.  **Install required Python libraries:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib requests astropy photutils astroquery reproject astroalign lightkurve aplpy scikit-image opencv-python plotly
    ```
    If you are working directly within a Jupyter Notebook cell, you can install packages (though less recommended for environment setup) using:
    ```python
    !pip install numpy pandas matplotlib requests astropy photutils astroquery reproject astroalign lightkurve aplpy scikit-image opencv-python plotly
    ```

    For best practice, you can also create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    requests
    astropy
    photutils
    astroquery
    reproject
    astroalign
    lightkurve
    aplpy
    scikit-image
    opencv-python
    plotly
    ```
    And then install using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Ensure all files and folders** from this repository are in the same main directory.
2.  **Verify library installation:** Open the `Main Code Sequence.ipynb` notebook. Run the first cell (which typically contains all `import` statements) to ensure all libraries are correctly installed and accessible.
3.  **Execute notebook cells:** Proceed to run the cells in the `Main Code Sequence.ipynb` notebook sequentially or as desired. The notebook is designed to be self-contained in terms of variable and array management as execution progresses. Output images and data will be saved to the `images/` directory where specified by the code.

## Deliverables

This section showcases some of the key visual outcomes from the Jupiter image analysis project.

**Outcome 1:**
This output displays a light curve (top) representing the average flux variation from a sequence of Jupiter observations (Cluster 2). The accompanying grid of images (bottom) shows the corresponding visual frames of Jupiter (observations 27-52), illustrating the planet's rotation and the transit of one of its moons and its shadow (visible from frame 46).

**Outcome 2:**
This figure presents an analysis of Jupiter's atmospheric bands. The left panel shows an enhanced image of Jupiter with its disk outlined, highlighting a moon shadow transit. The center panel displays a latitudinal intensity profile, quantifying the brightness variations across Jupiter's cloud bands, with identified zones (brighter regions) and belts (darker regions). The right panel shows the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of this intensity profile, revealing the dominant spatial frequencies and characteristic spacing of these atmospheric features.
