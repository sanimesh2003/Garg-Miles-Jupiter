## Project Overview

The primary objective of this research project is to develop and implement a robust workflow for analyzing astronomical images of Jupiter. This involves processing raw image data, identifying and characterizing features, and performing relevant computations to extract scientific insights. The code aims to provide a structured and reproducible approach to these tasks.

## Repository Structure

* **`Images/`**: Output directory for processed images and visualizations.
* **`jupiter_data_WFC3_F631DRC/`**: Input dataset of Jupiter images (WFC3 F631DRC).
* **`Main code sequence.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with the primary image processing and analysis pipeline.
* **`Orientation algorithm.ipynb`**: Experimental Jupyter Notebook for image auto-rotation using deep learning.
* **`parallel_worker.py`**: Python script supporting parallel processing functionalities in the main notebook.
* **`T2.jpg`**: Reference image used for model training and feature-based image rotation.
* **`README.md`**: This documentation file.

**File Explanations (Details):**

* **`Images/`**: This directory stores all output images, plots, and visual results generated by the `Main code sequence.ipynb` notebook.
* **`jupiter_data_WFC3_F631DRC/`**: Contains the raw FITS files and other data related to Jupiter observations used as input for this project.
* **`Main code sequence.ipynb`**: The core Jupyter Notebook that orchestrates the data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps. It includes detailed comments for clarity.
* **`Orientation algorithm.ipynb`**: A supplementary notebook detailing an experimental approach to automate image orientation using deep learning techniques.
* **`parallel_worker.py`**: A utility script designed to enable parallel execution of certain computationally intensive tasks within the main notebook, improving efficiency.
* **`T2.jpg`**: A reference image utilized in the `Orientation algorithm.ipynb` for training a model and performing key feature alignment for image rotation.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (for running `.ipynb` files)

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download files):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
    Alternatively, download all files and folders and ensure they are placed in the same root directory.

2.  **Install required Python libraries:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib requests astropy photutils astroquery reproject astroalign lightkurve aplpy scikit-image opencv-python plotly
    ```
    If you are working directly within a Jupyter Notebook cell, you can install packages (though less recommended for environment setup) using:
    ```python
    !pip install numpy pandas matplotlib requests astropy photutils astroquery reproject astroalign lightkurve aplpy scikit-image opencv-python plotly
    ```

    For best practice, you can also create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```
    numpy
    pandas
    matplotlib
    requests
    astropy
    photutils
    astroquery
    reproject
    astroalign
    lightkurve
    aplpy
    scikit-image
    opencv-python
    plotly
    ```
    And then install using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Ensure all files and folders** from this repository are in the same main directory.
2.  **Verify library installation:** Open the `Main code sequence.ipynb` notebook. Run the first cell (which typically contains all `import` statements) to ensure all libraries are correctly installed and accessible.
3.  **Execute notebook cells:** Proceed to run the cells in the `Main code sequence.ipynb` notebook sequentially or as desired. The notebook is designed to be self-contained in terms of variable and array management as execution progresses. Output images and data will be saved to the `Images/` directory where specified.
